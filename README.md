# Crowdfunding_ETL
ETL Project

**Part 1-3**
Code for creating the Campaign DF, Category DF, Subcategory DF, and Contacts DF is all inside of the ETL_Mini_Project.. Jupyter Lab file. 

**Part 4**
The crowedfunding_db_schema.sql files, screenshots of our database and select * code is inside of our **Resources file.** There are also screenshots highlighting the use of quickDB. 

The schema file includes our "Select *" code lines. These will give errors until the csv files are imported on the grader end. 

**Other Comments:**
Code was worked on together by Thomas Dunn, Jason Miller, Aimee Galindo, and Isaac Gish. 
The github repository for submission is owned by Jason Miller with the others as collaborators.
